# Guess the Number Game

It is a simple and interactive number guessing game. The computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player's objective is to guess the correct number. The game provides feedback on how close or far the player's guess is, guiding them towards the correct answer.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: The computer will randomly select a number within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100).
2. **Make a Guess**: Enter a number as your guess.
3. **Receive Feedback**: Based on your guess, the game will provide feedback:
   - Too Far: Player's guess is much higher or lower than the target number.
   - Far: Player's guess is still off but getting closer.
   - Close: Player's guess is near the target number.
   - Too Close: Player's guess is very close to the target number.
4. **Continue Guessing**: Adjust your guess based on the feedback until you find the correct number.
5. **Win the Game**: Once you guess the correct number, you win! You can then choose to play again.
